# AdventOfCode 2023

https://adventofcode.com/

I am attempting as much as I can via PHP. In years past, I have been successful for about 15 days before the challenges start to become either too time consuming or too overwhelming. 
The reason I think it gets challenging for most players is that Part 1 is often easy, and Part 2 sounds equally easy, but it becomes quickly apparent that you will run out of memory or that it will take years to solve
if you keep trying to solve Part 2 with the same code/logic as Part 1. Usually Part 2 requires thinking outside the box and may take several attempts.

Here's to 25 days of success!
